    Source/fix: Drag extending past monitor size
    
    When a small image is loaded and the edge of the
    image viewer is dragged or moved, it extends past
    the bounding edge of the active monitor.
    
    Close button color has been updated to a brighter
    color.

    Source/Minor: Improve startup time for pixzzle
    
    The time it takes for the shot tool to be activated
    has been improved by implementing thumbnail cache.
    The caching system saves a thumbnail image the
    first time the image is loaded into the
    `ThumbnailViewer`. This is the file/image that is
    loaded at every other time.
    
    We also save an indicator as an ancilliary chunk
    in the png screenshot that assists us in determining
    which thumbnail ought to be blurred. Thumbnails
    smaller in size than the `ThumbnailViewer`'s size
    are always blurred.

    Source/Fix: Window vertical expansion glitch
    
    When the window is dragged vertically and it hits
    the top and bottom boundary, it tends to bounce
    irregularly around that boundary giving off visual
    artifacts. To fix this, we use only update some
    endpoints based on if we are in drag mode or resize
    mode.
    
    Remove registered signal handlers for the `shutter`.

    Source/feat: Implement copying of current image
    
    User can use Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Shift+C to copy
    the current image in the big view. Ctrl+C copies
    the whole image, Ctrl+Shift+C copies the section
    currently visible in the viewport.
    
    Fixed issues pointed out by gnome reviewer in
    preparation for alpha-v2 release. This includes:
    - Removal of deprecated modules
    - Disposal of connection handlers
    - Removal of incompatible library imports
    - Proper initialization of translation
    
    Fix issue regarding vertical expansion glitch.
    When the window is dragged such that it touches
    both ends of the screen. It extends out of its
    containing view.

    Source/Fix: Resolve sticky cursor on drag
    
    If window is in drag mode and the cursor gets captured
    by a button, vfunc_key_release_event will not be

    event to be fired before releasing the cursor. To fix
    this, we listen to enter-event on all buttons and
    release the cursor on receiving such event.
    
    Window tiling mode is disabled due to implementation
    flaw. If would certainly be fixed in the next release.

    Source/feat: Implement page rotation
    
    The orientation of pages can be changed

    and Ctrl+L for anti-clockwise rotation.
    Each orientation keeps track of the
    current panning state. Panning to position

    The MainViewer has been configured to be
    constrained by the position of the gnome
    panel. The `Expand` indicator has been
    modified to follow suite.

    The UI has been redesigned with a new idea of
    thumbnails. Each shots taken are stored
    in the `USER_CACHE_DIR` which resolves
    to ~/.cache on debian. These are loaded into
    a viewport which displays a tiny thumbnail.
    Any of the entries in the side view when
    clicked, expands into a bigger view pane.
    
    Upcoming:
        - Implement a smarter expansion mechanism
          for the side view. Currently, the
          view expands in an horrible manner.

    Source/feat: Support for custom theming and config
    
    Nearly all sections of the main viewer can be customized
    to suit user's taste. The keybinding for toggling
    pixzzle can be changed from the default. Any key combo
    can be bound other than the page rotation control keys
    `Ctrl+R` and `Ctrl+L`. A reset button is also provided
    to restore user to original installation theme in case
    theming goes wrong. Directional panning control is also
    a customizable property for users preferring alternate
    panning direction other than natural.
    
    Gnome's top panel has been accounted for during dragging
    of the viewer. We don't allow pixzzle to expand past the
    top panel.

    Source/feat: Implement page rotation
    
    The orientation of pages can be changed
    by pressing Ctrl+R for clockwise rotation
    and Ctrl+L for anti-clockwise rotation.
    Each orientation keeps track of the
    current panning state. Panning to position
    before rotation restores the panned state
    on returning to the same orientation.
    
    Setup rotation animation for the settings
    button giving live to the MainViewer.
    
    The MainViewer has been configured to be
    constrained by the position of the gnome
    panel. The `Expand` indicator has been
    modified to follow suite.

    Source/feat: Implement full screen mode.
    
    The top, left and right edges have been made into
    hotspots for expansion. The top makes the view
    go into full screen mode, the left snaps the view
    to the left half of the screen right half for the
    right snap gesture.

    Source/Fix: Resolve big view expand crashes
    
    The upscale window crashes as a result
    of repeated reconstruction of
    `Clutter.ImageContent` element. This
    has been superseded by `Clutter.Canvas`.
    
    The wrong comment about BlurEffect has
    been removed and replaced with
    `Shell.BlurEffect`.

    Source/Minor: Build separate thumbnail view
    
    The UI has been redesigned with a new idea of
    thumbnails. Each shots taken are stored
    in the `USER_CACHE_DIR` which resolves
    to ~/.cache on debian. These are loaded into
    a viewport which displays a tiny thumbnail.
    Any of the entries in the side view when
    clicked, expands into a bigger view pane.
    
    Upcoming:
        - Implement a smarter expansion mechanism
          for the side view. Currently, the
          view expands in an horrible manner.
        - Improve hacks in code.
